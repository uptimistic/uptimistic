- 👋 Hi, I’m @uptimistic, I have Nuclear and Mechanical engineering degrees from UW-Madison and Columbia University-New York City.
-I am a non-traditional software developer/engineer with several years of skills carved out of  a hybrid combination of mathematics-heavy engineering/technical background while working on software development and engineering through Monte-Carlo based capstone projects, core design projects, graduate level machine learning research projects on spectral analysis as well as  self-taught software engineering spanning the areas of programming in, Python, MATLAB, Java, Javascript, HTML,CSS and C++. This will be my footprint representation of many years of software development journey for use in academia and industry.
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering and development covering a diversity of stacks ranging from front end through back end and databases
- 🌱 I’m currently learning full stack software development 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on full stack software development
