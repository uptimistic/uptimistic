- 👋 Hi, I’m @uptimistic, I have Nuclear and Mechanical engineering degrees from UW-Madison and Columbia University-New York City respectively.
-I am a non-traditional self-trained software developer/engineer with several years of skills carved out of  a hybrid combination of mathematics-heavy engineering/technical background while working on software development and engineering through Grow with Google Front-end ODIN-style project, Monte-Carlo based capstone projects, nuclear reactor core fuel  design projects, graduate level machine learning research projects on spectral analysis as well as  self-taught software engineering spanning the areas of programming in, Python, MATLAB, Java, Javascript, HTML,CSS and C++. This will be my footprint journal representation of many years of software development journey for use in academia and industry.
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering and development covering a diversity of stacks ranging from front end through back end and databases
- 🌱 I’m interested in pursuing endless learning habit and currently learning full stack software development wity specific focus on under the hood understanding rather than chasing tech frameworks that phase away
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a single or full stack software development
